## Buckets of Gratitude

### The big things I am grateful for: 
Family, food, healthy body, healthy mind, clean air to breathe, clean water, freedom.

### The little things I am grateful for:  
The smell of coffee and chocolate chip cookies, the way dogs greet you when you come home, long slow contemplative walks, the joy and excitement you feel getting ready to go to a concert or music festival, the ability to read and write, seeing my friends light up when they talk about their goals and dreams.

### The technical things that I am grateful for: 
The privilege to have internet and a laptop with access to unlimited information, podcasts, YouTube videos, online courses, apps that help us express our creativity, and now the Flatiron School community.

## Part of my WHY 

These three buckets of what I am grateful are part of my WHY I am on my coding journey. I am blessed to have my closest friends and family support my journey and shift in career choice. I am grateful for the food (and especially coffee) that fuels me physically and mentally, so I can focus on learning foreign concepts like Object Oriented Programming, APIs, Databases and Front-End. 

The "little things" are what give me balance and keep me grounded. When I get stuck on a bug or a concept I can't wrap my head around for sometimes hours or even a couple of days, baking some treats, taking a walk, or hanging out with loved ones helps me refresh and somehow something just "clicks" when I look at the code again, like magic. These little blessings and even struggles in life give us joy, and make tackling problems all the more satisfying.

More than ever, we are able to learn anything we ever want to with the Internet. Social Media, video platforms, blogs, podcasts, online courses are all resources we can use to learn code, make latte art, dance, yoga, new recipes or whatever your heart desires. I am grateful for the value and content I receive from these platforms and creators. With the abundance of information on the internet, it can also be overwhelming. That is why I applied for Flatiron. I am so grateful for mentorship from the instructors, the comradery with my fellow students and yet another support system to guide us and give us structure.

Gratitude helps me remember my WHY. Keep learning, keep creating, keep getting better. I find comfort in knowing we can always learn more, grow more. I think that's why I was drawn to coding in the first place. With gratitude I'm learning to find joy in my 'failures' because my 'small wins' give me so much excitement and push to learn more. This everyday practice of embracing failure keeps me curious and motivates me to work harder for those lightbulb moments that come with learning to code and build apps. The community I have behind me gives me a reason to keep going, to make them and myself proud. Gratitude has taught me to be happy with the present journey, but not complacent. 

## Challenges Make Us Grow

During times of uncertainty with COVID-19, lost jobs, a volatile economy, and fear, I invite you to remind yourself that there is still grace, hope, and always a reason to be grateful. I hope practicing gratitude for where you are now and how far you have to go will help you in your coding practice as well.
Every single chapter and "failure" we have in life challenges us give up or keep going. Every bug we need to fix, design philosophy, data structure or algorithm we need to learn propels us into growth. Sometimes that little voice tells us we cannot do it or we aren't smart enough. Have gratitude bring you back. Make a practice of writing or saying out loud what you are grateful for. I don't think it's a coincidence that there's a parallel between life itself and learning how to code. The journey is not always lateral. Pivot, take breaks, find another way, and always come back. Do not give up!

Thanks for reading and following along.

Happy coding!
